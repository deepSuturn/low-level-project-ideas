# Rust Watering Automation System

## Description

This project is a Rust-based watering automation system designed to manage the irrigation of plants automatically. The system uses sensors to monitor soil moisture levels and controls irrigation based on the readings. It integrates hardware components such as moisture sensors, water pumps, and a microcontroller to automate the watering process efficiently.

## Features

- **Automatic Irrigation**: Monitors soil moisture levels and waters the plants as needed.
- **Customizable Settings**: Allows configuration of watering schedules and thresholds via a configuration file.
- **Hardware Integration**: Supports various hardware setups for moisture sensing and water control.
- **Real-time Data**: Logs moisture levels and water usage, which can be viewed and analyzed.
- **Energy Efficient**: Optimized for low-power consumption to ensure longevity and sustainability.

## Architecture

- **Sensors**: Detect soil moisture levels using moisture sensors.
- **Controller**: A microcontroller processes data from the sensors and triggers irrigation.
- **Water Pump**: Activated by the controller to release water into the soil.
- **Power Management**: Runs on battery or external power with energy-efficient design.
